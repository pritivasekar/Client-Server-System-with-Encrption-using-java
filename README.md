# Client-Server-System-With-Encyption-using-java

## A cryptographic approach of developing an instant messaging client-server chat application using encryption and decryption algorithm on a network.

### The aim of the project is to develop a client server communication with security in mind,e.g.Military Communication
 
## Algorithm Used:
Each model would contain an encryption and decryption scheme using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm

AES is an iterative rather than Feistel cipher. It is based on
‘substitution–permutation network’. It comprises of a series of linked operations, some of which involve replacing inputs by specific outputs (substitutions) and others involve shuffling bits around (permutations).
